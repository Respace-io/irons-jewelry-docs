## About

#### Jewelry Items can be crafted from a pattern at the Jewelcrafting Station block. Some patterns are learned by the player by default, while others need to be unlocked by looting or trading for Artisan Scrolls.

#### Each pattern gives a type of bonus (such as bonus Attributes). The materials used determines the specific bonus, and the quality of materials used determines how strong the bonus is. Patterns and materials can be combined in order to create diverse and powerful creations. The only limits are the depths of your pockets -- the more precious the gems, the more powerful the product!

## Jeweler

#### Further, the player is not alone on their journey, as villagers will happily get busy at a Jewelcrafting Station. Jewelers will buy and sell materials, peddle finished pieces of jewelry, and sell the secrets of more advanced patterns.
